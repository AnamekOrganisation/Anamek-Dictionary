# Anamek Dictionary

**Open-source collaborative Amazigh–French dictionary**

## 📖 About the Project

Anamek-Dictionary is an open-source and collaborative Amazigh–French dictionary project.
Its main goal is to document the Amazigh language and make it accessible through a free, open, and community-driven platform.

The project is built on the belief that languages grow and survive through shared knowledge, collective contribution, and open access.
Rather than being a closed or static dictionary, Anamek-Dictionary evolves continuously thanks to its contributors.

## 🎯 Philosophy

- **Collaboration over centralization**  
  The dictionary is enriched by its community. Everyone can contribute to improving the codebase and the linguistic data.

- **Open source as a principle**  
  The source code is openly available to ensure transparency, sustainability, and long-term development.

- **Language documentation**  
  The project focuses on documenting Amazigh vocabulary, meanings, and usage in a structured and searchable way.

- **Accessibility and learning**  
  Anamek-Dictionary aims to make Amazigh language resources accessible to learners, researchers, and developers.
