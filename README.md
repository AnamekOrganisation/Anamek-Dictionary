**An open-source, collaborative Amazigh–French dictionary project.**  
*A living dictionary built by the community, for the community.*

---

## 📖 About the Project

**Anamek Dictionary** is an open-source and collaborative Amazigh–French dictionary.
Its main objective is to document the Amazigh language and make it accessible through a free, open, and community-driven platform.

Languages grow, survive, and evolve through shared knowledge.
Rather than being a closed or static dictionary, **Anamek Dictionary** is a living project that evolves continuously thanks to its contributors: native speakers, learners, developers, and researchers.

---

## 🎯 Philosophy

- **Collaboration over centralization**  
  Language belongs to its speakers. The dictionary is enriched collectively by its community.

- **Open source as a principle**  
  Open access ensures transparency, sustainability, and long-term development.

- **Language documentation**  
  Amazigh vocabulary, meanings, and usage are documented in a structured, searchable, and extensible way.

- **Accessibility and learning**  
  Designed to serve learners, linguists, researchers, and developers alike.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Build a reliable and extensible Amazigh–French dictionary platform  
- Encourage linguistic and technical contributions  
- Improve performance, security, and scalability  
- Provide a solid foundation for future tools (APIs, mobile apps, linguistic research)
